# Kosaraju

This project implements all stages of Exercise 3.

## Stage 1
**Files:** `kosaraju.c`, `main.c`, `Makefile`  
The directed graph implementation uses adjacency lists.

## Stage 3
**Files:** `kosaraju.c`, `main.c`  
Added `removeEdge` method and a method to receive, parse, and execute commands.  
All interactions use `stdin` and `stdout`.

## Stage 4
**Files:** `main.c`, `pollserver.c`, `tcp_dup.c`, `Makefile`  
Based on Beej's chat implementation, together with duplicating `stdin` and `stdout` with the client sockets to meet the requirements.

## Stage 5
**Files:** `reactor.c`, `Makefile`  
Created a static library `async_engine.a` implementing the reactor pattern.

Although the reactor can execute on the main thread, we chose to have the reactor poll loop run on a dedicated thread. This allows us to demonstrate the `stopReactor` method in the next stage.

The `stopReactor` method uses a pipe to communicate the stop request to the main thread.  
Note: To achieve this, we slightly modified the interface as follows:
- Added method `void *createReactor();` to create the internal reactor data structure.
- Changed `int startReactor(void *reactor_instance);` to receive the reactor instance as a parameter.

## Stage 6
**Files:** `reactor_impl.c`, `Makefile`  
Using the library, this stage implements two reactor functions for:
- Newly connected clients. The method registers the "data received" reactor functions for the newly connected client.
- "Data received" reactor function. This method interacts with the command functionality implemented in Stage 3.  
  The user will be prompted to "enter any key to terminate." When a key is entered, the `stopReactor` method is invoked.

## Stage 7
**Files:** `tcp_threads.c`, `Makefile`  
This stage implements an infinite loop blocking on `accept`. Upon `accept` returning with a new client socket, a new "receive from client" thread is created with the new client socket sent as the thread argument. The "receive from client" thread implements an infinite loop waiting on `recv`, and when data is received, it interacts with the command functionality implemented in Stage 3.

## Stage 8
**Files:** `proactor.c`, `Makefile`  
Added an implementation of the proactor pattern to the `async_engine.a` library.  
As with the reactor, we chose to have the proactor run on a dedicated thread. To implement the `stopProactor`, we made the following design decisions:
- Use a pipe to signal the main thread.
- Use the `poll` command on the listener socket and on the read end of the pipe.

This way, we can receive clients as in Stage 7 (using `poll` on the listener instead of `accept`), and receive a termination signal (using the pipe). The pipe is further used to allow disconnecting clients to communicate the disconnect event to the main thread for resource cleanup.  
Note: We slightly modified the interface of the proactor as follows:
- `void *startProactor(int sockfd, proactorFunc threadFunc);`
- `int stopProactor(void *proactor);`  
  This allows us to use an abstract pointer to the proactor, similar to the reactor, instead of using `pthread_t`.

## Stage 9
**Files:** `main.c`, `tcp_threads.c`  
Implemented Stage 7 using the proactor functionality added in Stage 8. The user will be prompted to "enter any key to terminate." When a key is entered, the `stopProactor` method is invoked.

## Stage 10
**Files:** `main.c`, `kosaraju.c`  
Starts a thread that monitors the crossing of the 50% threshold of vertices belonging to a single SCC. The thread waits on a `pthread_cond_t`. The `kosaraju` method signals the `pthread_cond_t` when the threshold crossing occurs.

## General Notes
- We use a single Makefile for both the executable and the static library.
- This single executable implements stages 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the exercise.
- To run the program from the project folder:
  - Compile: `make all`
  - Run: `bin/kosaraju <stage>` where `<stage>` can be one of: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- We define `_GNU_SOURCE` for the project to use the `pthread_timedjoin_np` method. (https://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread_timedjoin_np)
